Description: This package provides a series of tools that allow for the analysis of energy generation
        data on the monthly and yearly scales. Monthly nameplate generation (ie maximum generation) and
        percent generation (ie. net generation as a percentage of nameplate) can be calculated and averaged
        per year for individual plants. All of this data can then be graphed, either monthly trends compared
        between years or yearly trends.
